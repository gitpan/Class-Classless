	* Release 1.33 -- supports memoization (caching) of each object's
	lineage.
	* Minor doc changes.
	* Dispatcher now uses "magic goto" to pass off to sub methods.
	I think that should make for proper @_-aliasing and context
	propagation.
	* Fixed obscure bug in 'pretty' (used by the EXAMINE method) that
	would mistake some "0"-initial numerals for real decimal numbers.

	* Added support for 'constant methods' (and magic dereferencing)

	   and set_fail_undef
	* Added $callstate->via_next

	   true
